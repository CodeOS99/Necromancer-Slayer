## Tutorial
### First Stage
In the first stage, you just need to platform and use the trampoline to get the key on top of the framework of the building.
### Second Stage
After hitting the dead end, drop down. The Eye gives hints, such as how the necromancer won't be able to damage you itself, and how beating the boss has something to do with obelisks.
After activating the boss fight, the Boss may do any one of two attacks, shooting a semi-homing skull in one, and summoning a random amount of three(zombie, mushroom, flying monster) monsters automatically.
#### Zombie
The Zombie moves slowly however attacks at a decent time as well. Normal lifespan.
#### Mushroom
The Mushroom walks fast however has bad timing of attack. Normal lifespan.
#### Flying Monster
The Flying Monster can go through walls, unlike the other two. Medium speed and small lifespan.

To beat the boss, you must destroy 5 obelisks scattered throughout the map. Their location is <b>not</b> randomized.
#### Location #1
Past the place where the fire trap is.
#### Location #2
Left two where the player is when the boss is spawned.
#### Location #3
Near the trampoline at the place the player drops down in the beginning.
#### Location #4
It is left to Location #4
#### Location #5
Near to where the player initially spawn. This may be reached by any of the two trampolines near Locations 3 and 4.

To destroy the obelisk, get close enough to them, where the text about how to destroy the obelisk starts showing, and press 'k'.

### End
Not much to it. If all seven of the bonus points are collected, the bottom text glows in celebration.

Enjoy :D
